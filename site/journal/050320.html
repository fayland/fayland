<h1>A trip to the Yellow Mountain</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Category: <a href='Diary.html'>Diary</a> &nbsp; Keywords: <b>trip</b></p>I spent this weekend travelling the Yellow(Huang) Mountian with my classmates. 2 days and 260 Yuan, and I think it's worth the time and money.<p>

The most time We do is climbing, having a break, and climbing again.<br>
The first day is a rainy day, and we climbed through the rain and were wetted from head to foot.<br>
It's nearly 19:00 until we arrived the cheap hotel. It's dark then and we can hardly see the road under the feet. luckily, no one hurt.<br>
We planned to have a sight of the famous sunrise in the next day, but the heavy fog disappointed us.<br>
It's just another climbing-day. But with luck, we met the wild monkeys down the mountain road. we threw some pieces of bread to please them, and us.<p>

The deepest thing in my memory is the heaver, or we called them porter. They climbed more than 8 kilometers with heavy goods only to earn 33 Yuan. And it's a shame that they are quicker than us.<p>

To have a full sight within 2 days is a difficult task, and it's a pity we missed the sunrise.<br>
I think I'll go to the Yellow Mountain with my lovely girlfriend in another day.<p>

Now I'm too tired and eager to have a nice sleep. God bless me.<p></div>
