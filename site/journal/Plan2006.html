<h1>Plan for 2006: hang myself on the tree of Perl</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Category: <a href='Diary.html'>Diary</a> &nbsp; Keywords: <b>Plan</b></p>The year of 2006 would be a turn in the course of events.<br />I'm going to receive my bachelor's degree in advertisement next June, and I'll attend the post-graduate entrance exam in January 14th-15th.<br />So the future seems so unclear that I'm not sure what will I do and where will I go. Maybe go to work related with Perl, maybe stay at home doing SOHO work concerned with internet and Perl, or maybe continue my study in Tsinghua university, which I like best.<p />Although there is so many possibilities, yet one thing is certain: keep abreast with Perl.<br />There is no plan for a new language such as Python, Ruby, Java or C/C++/C#.<br />Ya, maybe a functional language like ML or Haskell, I'm not sure.<br />The Perl world is so immense that I still need to learn a lot.<br /><ul>The planned stuff are as follows:<br /><li>Perl 6. yes, I think Autrijus will release an official Perl 6 implement - <a href="http://www.pugscode.org">Pugs</a>, it's worth time to learn Perl 6 and play with it.<br /><li><a href='http://www.parrotcode.org/'>Parrot</a>. the PIR language. I like the idea of parrot.<br /><li><a href="http://perl.apache.org">modperl</a>. It's still popular and quicker than what you expected. I hate to consider speed when I write perl code.<br /><li><a href='http://poe.perl.org/'>POE</a>. I know you guys are tired of the threads thing in Perl, me too. and event-driven is great.<br /><li>take part in more open-source projects. It's a goold place to practise and improve my skill.<br /><li>use <a href="http://dev.catalyst.perl.org">Catalyst</a> to write a script of Forum and other script. more than 3,000 lines, I suppose.<br /><li>part time jobs are welcome. I do need more money to live better.<br /></ul>Woo, so many things. I just wonder whether I get enough time to dig the Perl treasure.<br />Ya, it's my plan. I'll do my best to adhere to my plan.</div>
