<p>Category: <a href='Diary.html'>Diary</a> &nbsp; Keywords: <b>complaints</b></p>If my life had rolled back (like svn revert?), I have decided not to attend the postgraduate entrance examination. hey, it doesn't mean that I fail my exam. Technically speaking, it's too early to say so.<br />I just feel so tired and want to have a long long rest. I ask my roommate to buy a bus ticket for me and I'll return home within this week.<p />Frankly, the test is out of the ordinary, exactly, out of my expection.<br />The exam "Economics" should be to blame. It's 150 points totally, but three items(subjects) account for 110 points and the other 20 items only take 40 points.<br />I'm definitely against this. I devote my time and energy to 2 books which have more than 1000 pages.<br />The "three" items seem like gambling and I maybe loss during the guess.<br />In my opionion, it should be more than 20 items account for 110 points.<br />I'm not sure that I answer the "three big issue" correctly.<br />Yup, you are right. I am the second object to be reproached because of my laziness.<p />It's maybe my last examination since my study is nearly close. Woo, freedom.<p />Some complaints. God bless me.</div>
